***I'm here to share a bit about myself and the journey that has led me to where I am today.*** At 36 years old, I've spent a significant portion of my life working in the aerospace industry, specializing in aeronautical tinsmith and coppersmith roles with Airbus. It all began back in 2004 when I embarked on this path at the age of 16, and over the years, I've honed my skills and contributed to various projects.

In 2008, there was a significant shift as the Airbus site I was working at became part of GKN Aerospace. Despite the changes, I remained committed to my work, and to this day, I continue to be an integral part of the GKN Aerospace team.

However, alongside my career in aerospace, I've also pursued further education. In 2017, while still working full-time, I enrolled in a part-time BSc Computing & IT and Design Degree with The Open University. Juggling work and studies was undoubtedly challenging, but it was a challenge I was willing to take on. And in 2022, I achieved something I'm incredibly proud of â€“ a First-Class Honours degree.

Now, with this academic achievement under my belt, I'm looking towards the future. I'm eager to embark on a new career path in Software Engineering/Development. It's a field that has always intrigued me, and I believe my blend of practical experience and academic knowledge will serve me well in this transition.

So, as I step into this new chapter of my professional life, I invite you to follow along. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that lie ahead.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure.
